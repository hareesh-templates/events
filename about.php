                        <p> Hi! My name is Eesha Ampani and I created this website to share more about myself and the things I do. I am 16 years old and a junior at the Episcopal Academy in Newtown Square, PA. At school, I especially love to take art classes, be on the diving team, volunteer for various community service opportunities, and spend time with my friends.</p>
                        <p>Art is one of my favorite hobbies and I have always found an outlet in drawing and painting since elementary school. I also love playing the piano and have been taking lessons for the past 10 years; I consider piano to be another amazing outlet. I also love to bake and sing. My family and I enjoy traveling and spending time with each other. I currently live in Audubon, PA with my parents and my older sister as well as our dog, Teddy. I hope you enjoy this site!</p>
