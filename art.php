                        <p style="padding: 10px;">This was the first studio art project we did this year inspired by the flora and fauna collages of Georgia O'Keefe. Immediately after completing this project, I realized I was subconsciously inspired by the temples I had visited in India the month prior: details like the colored tile stairs, pink lotus flowers, and the asian snow leopards are artistic subjects found all over India, especially in the colorful temples..</p>

                        <p style="padding: 10px;">This was a painting I did in my home studio during this past winter break. It is a skull still life with roses and petals collaged on top of it. The medium is water-soluble oil paints on top of a 12 x 12 canvas board. This inspiration for this piece just came from this idea I had that I went with; the only thing about this piece that really changed after I started was the color of the tablecloth being green and that there is also a pink rose and a red rose, instead of just white roses.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 10px;">This is a piece we made in my art class in school. It is acrylic paint on bristol board and the prompt was graphic-novel self portrait. I chose to make my story about a tsunami wave that I see coming but cannot escape until it eventually engulfs me. We were told to use a limited palette of 5 colors but I mostly kept my palette shades of blue.</p>

                        <p style="padding: 10px;">This is a sketch of a skeleton that we did in my art class as preparation for a portrait project that we are working on. It was very important to keep in mind the exact proportions of a human because if the proportions were not met the skeleton would not look like a human and eventually our portrait would not resemble a human either. I really enjoyed learning about portraits and the human body and I am happy my skeletonâ€™s proportions came out successfully.</p>
