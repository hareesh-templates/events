                            <h4 style="text-align:center;">Project Introduction</h4>
                           
                            <p>This post details the initiative I took this summer to educate people in rural South India on the importance of the COVID vaccine, give them the opportunity to get vaccinated in their villages, and give those who got vaccinated a small incentive to thank them for their decision. I came up with this idea in early July 2021, when I was planning a trip to India and realized how destructive the Delta variant of COVID was there. When I saw that there was an abundance of vaccines in the United States, some of which were going to waste because of hesitation amongst people to get vaccinated, while conversely, India had a shortage of vaccines yet a high awareness of the importance and safety of getting vaccinated,  I wanted to help more Indian people to get vaccinated. Being a first-generation Indian-American, most of my extended family lives in India, so they were able to offer me the help I needed for this important project. This project would not have been possible without their help, as well as the help of so many people and volunteers who are all listed at the end of this paper and will be mentioned throughout. My fluency in Telugu was a skill I was able to utilize in communicating with rural villagers who had never seen an American before; I believe that forming a connection with them was vital in the success of my project. At the end of the project, after visiting 5 villages with an average adult population of 500, we were able to administer 500 first doses of CoviShield to around 100 people at each village.  </p><br>

                             <h4 style="text-align:center;">Planning and Inception</h4>
                           
                            <p>I came up with the initial ideas for this project in early July 2021. I knew I would be spending around 4 weeks in India during August and although I knew I would be busy visiting family and traveling to different places, I really wanted to do more with my time in India that would not only be productive for me but would also make a big impact in the communities that I visited. Seeing how destructive the Delta variant of COVID was in India during April and May of 2021 really affected me because of the sense of home I have always found in India and my large extended family who lives there. My first idea was to set up a vaccine drive in the major city of Hyderabad, where I spend most of my time in India, so that I could help people get protection against COVID. After doing some research on the topic and speaking with medical professionals in and around Hyderabad, I realized that it would be too large of an initiative to undertake and not very impactful; a large percentage of the city’s population had already received both doses of the Astra-Zeneca CoviShield and even more people had received their first dose, with the second dose on standby due to a shortage of vaccines. On top of that, there was enough being done in Hyderabad as the city is modernizing quickly and has become a large technology hub in Southern India. I decided to redirect my efforts out of Hyderabad and into the small villages on its outskirts to see if there were any opportunities for change in areas where there were no resources for COVID protection. I chose to look into the area in and around my mother’s hometown of Kothakota, an extremely small and rural village two and a half hours outside of Hyderabad. Almost the entirety of my mother’s extended family lives in Kothakota and is working to better the community, so I got in touch with some relatives to see what I could do to help. I was disappointed that it seemed I could only have a small-scale impact in the villages bordering Kothakota; everyone said that there were only 100 vaccines per day at the Kothakota Public Health Center, which serves the greater area as well, and to allot even half of those to my cause would be a risk, as any unused vaccines would have to be trashed. There was an underlying fear that the villagers in these neighboring towns had of the vaccine itself; not even 1% of the combined populations of the 5 neighboring villages had gotten vaccinated or had plans to get vaccinated. This led me to another idea: to educate those who were fearful of getting vaccinated about the benefits and the importance of the vaccination, give them the opportunity to get vaccinated, and even provide a small incentive to thank them for their choice and at the very least give them a reason to choose to get vaccinated. Even with this new idea, our scale was small: we only expected to have 10-20 people at most from each village agree to be taken by tractor to the Kothakota PHC (Public Health Center) and receive their first dose of the CoviShield vaccine. At this scale, the project would have resulted in around 100 people getting vaccinated.</p><br>

                             <h4 style="text-align:center;">First Week in India: Project Preparation</h4>
<p>The first week I spent in India after quarantining post-arrival was in Hyderabad, where I spent time working on the preparations for my project. I decided to go with an incentive of some steel dishes and hygienic products which added up to a price of 160 rupees, or $2.15. I also wanted to give those who got vaccinated a sturdy bag that they could get use out of, which cost another 100 rupees or $1.35. This put the price of each incentive bag at only around $3.50, but to the villagers, these bags would make a great difference in their daily lives by offering them another water vessel or plate to eat off of and a bar of soap which they might have been without. The final contents of the incentive included a bar of soap, 2 surgical face masks, a steel cup, a steel plate, and a larger steel drinking vessel, all of which were put into a cloth bag. During this time I also designed a simple logo for my project to unify it across all aspects and chose a name based on the incentive: Goodies Against COVID. This project would not have been possible without the help of my great-uncle P. Vishweshwar, who is deeply involved in community service in Kothakota and was able to help me find the villages we decided to visit:</p><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Nancharammapet</b> - Population around 500</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Natavelli</b> - Population around 2500</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Sankireddipalle</b> - Population around 2500</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Govindahalli</b> - Population around 700</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Jangala Colony (Kothakota)</b> - Population around 250</p><br>
<p>My great-uncle also introduced me and my project to Sri Ala Venkateshwar Reddy, the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) of the Devarakadra district, who provided a lot of support and resources for the project.  </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Arrival in Kothakota</h4>
<p>After the first week of preparation in Hyderabad, my mom and I went to Kothakota to stay for the next week. The first day we spent in Kothakota we prepared all the incentive bags and made about 150, which was still our estimate of the number of people we would support. Unexpectedly, however, I was informed that MLA Reddy had called the PHC after hearing about this project and told them to send nurses and vaccines to be on-site at the villages so that we did not have to worry about transporting people to and from the vaccine site. This made a huge difference in our plan, as now those who wanted to get vaccinated but could not leave their villages for reasons other than transport would have the opportunity to. Along with this, we were allotted the full 100 vaccines per day from the PHC.</p><br>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/goodies3.png" width="200px"></p><br>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Project Kickoff and Daily Program: Natavelli Thanda</h4>
<p>On the first day of the program, we went to Natavelli Thanda. Early in the morning, with the help of many people, we were able to set up a tent and chairs to make the villagers coming to the drive feel more comfortable. The nurses from the PHC came with the vaccines and set up a vaccination site in the small village schoolhouse. With the help of the MLA, a PHC doctor and the heads of the village were able to come and speak to the villagers about the importance of getting vaccinated. The village leaders had already informed the villagers about the program so by 11:00am around 150 people were seated in the tent. I spoke to the villagers and told them about my reason for being there, the importance of the vaccination, and how I was going to thank them (with the goodie bags). Since my ability to speak Telugu is more conversational than fluent, my mom was able to help me along and deliver my words in a more fluent way. I had been warned by others that the people in the village had never seen an American before and the thought of an American trying to get them to take the vaccine could make them aggressive; however, I found the complete opposite to be true and felt extremely welcomed by everybody. I was greeted respectfully with namaskars and called akka - the way to address an older sister in Telugu - by the younger kids there. All of these villages were specifically unique in the area, I found out, because of the presence of a Banjara tribe population. The Banjara people originate from Afghanistan, but are nomadic people and so have a large presence, especially in the state of Telangana. I had never gotten the chance to interact with them before, and I learned about their culture, specifically about the language they speak among themselves and the clothing they wear. They were extremely welcoming to me, even though none  of them had met an American before. The Banjara people feared the vaccine because of the stories they had heard: people's limbs falling off, the vaccine causing people to drop dead, etc. However, when I explained to them that these stories were not true at all, and that the vaccine is the most reliable way to prevent death from COVID, they, as well as many others in the local population, were eager to take the vaccine. The leaders and doctors who spoke were key to the success of this first day; without them and their ability to gain support from the villagers through their public speaking skills I am sure that we would not have had the amount of success that we did. After the speeches were over, everyone who wanted to get vaccinated was invited to do so at the schoolhouse. After receiving their first dose of CoviShield, the villagers wrote down their personal information on a ticket which we then collected when giving them their bags. They were monitored by the nurses for 15 minutes after their vaccine and were given mango juice for sugar as well. After about an hour of vaccinations, we ran out of vaccines for the day. Everyone who was present at the drive was equally excited about the achievement we accomplished: the nurses, the local politicians, and the villagers. We were able to vaccinate 100 adults in a village with a population of only 500 including children; this meant that we took the vaccination rate from 0% to over 20% of adults (the exact number of adults isn’t known, but is most likely around 300). Everyone who was vaccinated at Natavelli Thanda was able to receive their goodie bag and after the program, all the tickets were given to the nurses so that when a second dose became available, those who had been vaccinated could be contacted about receiving it.</p><br>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Project Day 2: Nacharampeta Thanda</h4>
<p>On the second day of the program, we went to another small village with a population of 500, Nacharampeta Thanda. The night before, we had bought more of the items for the goodie bags and got more bags made locally so that we could put together around 400 more goodie bags, based on the numbers we saw at Natavelli Thanda. The program followed the same format as Natavelli Thanda, with the vaccination site also being set up in the village schoolhouse. The leaders of the village were extremely helpful with their support for my idea and made it a success by informing their villagers of the importance of getting vaccinated both for their village and for their individual families. On this day, I was even told by the nurses and a few of the villagers that I had to have my marriage in this area so they could all come. This talk about hosting my marriage was in the most endearing sense, as marriage is a big part of Indian culture. At Nacharampeta Thanda we were able to vaccinate 100 more people and give them each a goodie bag. The adult population of Nacharampeta Thanda is about 250 people, so we brought the vaccination rate from under 5% to 40%.</p><br>

<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Day 3: Break</h4>
<p>On the third day of our stay in Kothakota we did not have any programs planned, so we could do other things relating to the project. We assembled more bags and spoke to some local press about our project. I was extremely excited that the newspapers had taken an interest in my project and our team’s story, and this press also brought more attention to the project and allowed for even more people to decide to get vaccinated.</p><br>

<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Project Day 4: Govinda Halli and Jangala Colony</h4>
<p>On the fourth day of the project, we had only planned to go to Govinda Halli, but the head of the Jangala Colony of Kothakota became interested in our project and asked us if we could visit there as well. We were able to get 200 vaccines for this day from the Kothakota PHC. We visited Govinda Halli, which has a population of 700 people, in the morning. We followed the same structure as previously, starting with some words from myself and my mom as well as the leaders of the village and health specialists from the PHC, after which everyone who wished could get their vaccine. Additionally, MLA Reddy came to see this morning program and spoke to the people of Govinda Halli about the importance of the vaccination. Because of his visit, local journalists and newspapers came to report on our project and take pictures of the program. At Govinda Halli we vaccinated 100 people who all received incentive bags after their vaccination. After Govinda Halli, we went to the Jangala colony for afternoon programming. All of the locations we had visited previously were villages, and although the people who lived there were isolated and did not have much technology or media access, they were still towns with individual houses and public buildings such as schoolhouses, small medical shops, and small food carts. Jangala Colony was a slum behind an oil extraction plant and gas station, and the people there lived in immense poverty with almost no resources closeby. Because of this, their fear of the vaccine was much more heightened and many left the colony or hid in their rooms when we came, thinking that they would be forced to take the vaccine. Once our programming started, more people began to show up from the colony after hearing what I and the other speakers said about the importance and safety of the vaccine. One of the most meaningful moments of my project took place at Jangala colony: I met a young girl, around 20 years old, who had been stricken with polio when she was young because she couldn’t get vaccinated against it. when I was able to help her receive her COVID vaccine, it truly was so special and hugely impacted my outlook on what exactly I was doing. At Jangala colony we were able to vaccinate another 100 people.<p><br>

<br>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Project Day 5: Sankireddipalli</h4>
<p>The 5th and final day of programming took place at Sankireddipalli. The MLA came to this event too and we were also joined by other local politicians who were highly respected by the people of the town. The programming was similar, but due to the amount of press, the introduction and speeches portion ran slightly longer to inform all the journalists about every aspect of the project. We also served lunch to the villagers who came to the program, and as usual gave those who got vaccinated goodie bags to thank them. At Sankireddipalli we were able to vaccinate close to 100 people. </p><br>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Project Overview</h4>
<p>The week we spent in Kothakota and the six villages we visited to set up the vaccine drives was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had for many reasons. In total, across the 6 locations, we vaccinated just under 500 people who each received an incentive bag of items they needed and could get a lot of use out of. The amount of people my project was able to get vaccinated was truly shocking to me; I initially was not sure if my idea would be a success or make a community-wide difference. The ability, thanks to my parents’ funding, to give each person who got vaccinated a gift bag of things they needed was a small but extremely rewarding aspect of the project; the gratefulness of everyone who received one showed me that even such a small act of service can have a really large impact on someone. In addition, the 6 villages I visited gave me a new perspective on rural living and people living in poverty.  I learned so much about how people in rural areas live, not only in India but also internationally,  and the true lack of resources they  face. I was met with an outpouring of gratitude from the villagers and all the people I met, even though they had to overcome any personal fears they might have had towards a complete foreigner, and I honestly have never felt more welcomed than I did that week. Not only did I feel like I was serving the people from where my mother grew up and where I spent countless weeks throughout my childhood, but they made me feel like I was truly one of them - an international community member. Being able to communicate with the villagers in their native language and bridge the gap between us was such a rewarding experience personally and showed me how important being bilingual is to my identity and just in general, as an international citizen. The gratitude I have for everyone who supported me in my efforts, especially the people I was able to meet in the villages, is immense, and I will always remember and be thankful for this experience. </p><br>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Future Goals</h4>
<p>I hope to travel back to India in the summer of 2022 and kickstart Goodies Against Covid once again, if the need for vaccinations is prevalent, or even try a similar initiative in a different area of the public health crisis.  </p><br>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">Thank You's</h4>
<p>This project would not have been successful or even possible without the help of so many people who put great effort into an initiative that was not their own and which they did not know would be successful. I received so much support during my time in India and I will forever be thankful for all those who helped me in all the different areas and nuances of the project. My mom and I, both of us living in America, could only plan so much before we arrived in India and would not have been able to achieve anything once we arrived without the outpouring of support we received. I would especially like to thank my great-uncle, P. Vishsweshwar, for putting his full effort into the planning of this project. With his help, we were able to get in touch with the local leaders (sarpanches) of the villages as well as the PHC, and he was an essential part of the project’s success. His initiatives do not go unnoticed and I am extremely thankful for his help. I would also like to thank my great-aunt P. Sukeshini, the municipal chairperson of Kothakota, for her investment in my project and the ability and resources she provided towards it. I would also like to thank the MLA Sri Ala Venkateshwar Reddy, for helping us to get vaccines onsite and bringing the attention of the local press to the project so that we could expand it. His efforts and his visits to the programming were extremely kind and helpful. Finally, the people who spoke at the programming were key in raising village support for the project and with their help we were able to vaccinate large percentages of the populations. I am extremely grateful to all the following:</p><br>
